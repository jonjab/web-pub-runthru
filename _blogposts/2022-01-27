Dr. Barry was born (and raised) a female until leaving Ireland to attend medical school in
Edinburgh, Scotland as a man. She had a distinguished career as a military doctor in 
the British Empire.

There is evidence that she had a child as a teenager, possibly the result of abuse by her father or uncle.

# My New Website
A full start-to-end implementation of the Web Publishing with Github Pages Carpentry lesson

## Markdown examples
I can **bold** text for emphasis.

Vanilla text may contain *italics* and **bold words**.

This paragraph is separated from the previous one by a blank line.(no space)
Line breaks(two spaces)  
are caused by two trailing spaces at the end of a line.(one spaces) 
[Carpentries Webpage](https://carpentries.org/)

*so people who say two spaces after a sentence doesn't matter any more are WRONG!*

### Again
Soft line
break with a *carriage return*

2-space hard line  
break

### Carpentries Lesson Programs:
- Software Carpentry
- Data Carpentry

## Challenge 1
Hello, [this is a link](https://ucsbcarpentry.github.io), while ~~this text is strikethrough~~
(I found *strikethrough* on the [advanced page](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#strikethrough) of the cheatsheet.

### A lesser heading
1. And a number list
2. Do I really need to number myself?
1. No. This is all 1. markdown
1. Because I don't want to manyually change.
1. But github editor helps me.

A full start-to-end implementation of the Web Publishing with Github Pages Carpentry lesson

## Markdown examples
I can **bold** text for emphasis.

Vanilla text may contain *italics* and **bold words**.

This paragraph is separated from the previous one by a blank line.(no space)
Line breaks(two spaces)  
are caused by two trailing spaces at the end of a line.(one spaces)

*so people who say two spaces after a sentence doesn't matter any more are WRONG!*
